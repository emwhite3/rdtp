To run the protocols, you must run two files: “Receiver.py” and “Sender.py”. Receiver.py must be run first.
You can specify gbn or snw with the following commands (Any filename can be entered, file will be created in runtime):

SNW Protocol: python3 Receiver.py <filename>.txt snw
GBN Protocol: python3 Receiver.py <filename>.txt gbn

Sender.py can now be ran. To run a specific protocol you must specify it in the arguments.
The file to read from must also be specified. (The default setup file to read is “bio.txt”):

SNW Protocol:		python3 Sender.py bio.txt snw
GBN Protocol:		python3 Sender.py bio.txt gbn

Lastly once output on Sender.py has stopped and the program states that all packets have been sent you must type “quit” and press enter to terminate the program.
